<h2 id="what-is-a-kubernetes-operator-by-the-way">What is a Kubernetes Operator by the way?</h2>
<hr>
<p>A Kubernetes Operator is a <em>Controller</em> of a specific application.</p>
<p>As the Kubernetes documentation states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Operators are software extensions to Kubernetes that make use of custom resources to manage applications and their components. Operators follow Kubernetes principles, notably the control loop’.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-is-a-custom-resource-definition">What is a Custom Resource Definition?</h2>
<hr>
<p>The Custom Resource Definition (CRD) is an object in Kubernetes that allows us to create our own Custom &ldquo;Kind&rdquo; defining what are the properties it will have.</p>
<p>In this way, besides of the native objects of Kubernetes like, for exampĺe, Deployment or Ingress, we can create our Custom Resources and will be the Operator the one who is in charge of the reconcile logic of our new resource.</p>
<p>Within the Operator live the rules that define the behaviour of our Custom Resources: when it should be deleted, when it should be updated, which objects should it create or the validations it must do.</p>
<h2 id="spec-status-and-metadata">Spec, Status and Metadata.</h2>
<hr>
<p>The Metadata is, as its name says, the data about that specific resource. Most common fields for the metadata are  Name, Namespaces and Annotations. Those are the one you usually define when you are creating a resource. But there are more that can be very useful in order to control its lifecycle.</p>
<p>On the other side, you probably noticed that in your Deployments there is this field called <strong>Spec</strong>. Within the spec key there are various fields that changes depending on the <strong>Kind</strong> of your object. Deployments have different Spec fields than Ingress or Services.</p>
<p>They are basically the fields that must be filled with values by the user in order to tell Kubernetes what are we expecting to have.</p>
<p>The <strong>Spec</strong> fields for your Custom Resource are declared in your Custom Resource Definition. You are telling Kubernetes what are the fields supposed to be filled by the user.</p>
<p>You also declared <strong>Status</strong> fields within de CRD. It serves to observe the current status of the resource while the Operator is changing it. The Operator will read the Specs, will try to make the needed changes and it will update the status during the process. Once the Spec declated matches the object living in Kubernetes the Status will stop updating and the resource</p>
<h2 id="the-reconcile-loop">The Reconcile Loop.</h2>
<hr>
<p>Kubebuilder and OperatorSDK will help you with this Reconcile Loop. With the mentioned Framework I was aable to write the logic to <em>reconcile</em> those diferences between the desired state and the actual state.</p>
<p>To understand this topic very down to Earth, the Reconcile Loop will be a method in your Operator Code, already declared and provided by the framework you chase.</p>
<p>Every time that a Custom Resource linked to this Operator is changed, the Reconcile Loop will start receiving the data of the object that will modify.</p>
<p>Here is when you need to check if the object must be deleted, updated or created, and write the logic in accordance to those actions.</p>
<h2 id="external-or-internal-resources">External or Internal Resources.</h2>
<hr>
<p>When you are creating an Operator you will notice that there are mainly two alternatives. You will want to control a resource or a couple of resouces running within your cluster. Or in the other hand you will want to control resources outside your cluster.</p>
<p>The first option is very common, there are a lot of Operators around that help us with managing Prometheus deployments, MySQL databases, or Nginx Ingress Controllers. This kind of Operator creates resources that live in the cluster. At the end of the day, the custom resources are backed by pods running a particular application. Of course, they save you from a lot of manual intervention and that&rsquo;s the best of the Operators.</p>
<p>For the second option an example can be the creation of a DynamoDB instance in AWS. This resource won&rsquo;t live inside the cluster. Is an external resource. You will have to use the AWS SDK to create/modify/update the resource, which will be represented within the cluster by an object, for example, with the name &ldquo;dynamoDB&rdquo;. Perhaps you can run <code>kubectl get dynamodb</code> and a list with your tables will show below, those are just representations of your external resources. Those objects serves to maintain the status and as a interface for the users to create this resource from the cluster and not having to log in to the AWS Console to create it.</p>
<p>Various useful things can be done with this kind of operator. You will want to automate the creation of the IAM Role required to access de DB created. You can also could create a Secret or a Config Map with related information.</p>
<h2 id="garbage-collector-and-object-ownership">Garbage Collector and Object Ownership</h2>
<hr>
<p>As I mentioned before, your Operator will create not only one Kubernetes resource each time. It can create various associated items.
Let&rsquo;s think about a native resource of Kubernetes: The Deployment. When you create a Deployment you are creating at least a Pod. What happens if you delete the Pod associated to the Deployment. It will be relaunched. Why? Because the Deployment owns it, and it&rsquo;s watching it. The controller for the Deployment is triggered when the Pod is deleted, and it <em>reconciles</em> the desired status by launching again your Pod.</p>
<p>If you delete the Deployment, all the &ldquo;child&rdquo; Pods will be deleted. Why does the Pods get deleted when the Deployment is deleted too? Because of the Kubernetes Garbage Collector. If you have a resource that owns other resources, when the parent resource is deleted, the paretnless child resources are deleted by the Garbage Colletor, so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about writing a logic to delete al the child resources that your resource have.</p>
<p>This was very tricky for me to accomplish and it still looks as magic trickery, so I give you some links where you can read more about the implementation.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="finalizers">Finalizers</h2>
<hr>
<p>The <em>finalizer</em> field is a field that lives in the metadata. When the field is present your resource (or any Kubernetes resource) won&rsquo;t be deleted even when you hit Intro with all your forces. This field is very useful when your Operator manages external resources.</p>
<p>If you delete a internal resource it will just disappear. But if you delete an Kubernetes Resource that has a external resource (remember our dynamoDB example below), the resource representation in the cluster will be erased but the external resource will be alive.</p>
<p>The trick here is to assign a finalizer value to the Custom Resources which represent the external resource when this is created.</p>
<p>That way when you run <code>kubectl delete myresouce</code>it won&rsquo;t be deleted automatically and there es when you have time to run the logic to dlete your external resource. Once it&rsquo;s deleted you can remove the finalizer value and your resource will be finally deleted.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
