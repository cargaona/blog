Denis is a highly configurable distributed system we created in MercadoLibre.
It aims to solve misconfigurations[^1] in public clouds automatically at a
big scale. 

Me and my project leader were part of the main track at the [EkoParty Security
Conference](https://www.ekoparty.org/en_US/) of this year talking about the
concepts behind the system, some of the problems we faced and the future of
this solution as an open source project.

It was the first time speaking in an event like this for me, and beyond the
talk was recorded with no public, I felt really comfortably doing it. I guess I
could repeat this experience anytime soon.

Regarding Denis, I had a bunch of fun developing this project and learned a lot
during the process of making this system alive. Also, it served me as an excuse
to read this book I had in my _read later queue_ from an eternity ago:
[Designing Data-Intensive
Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/).[^2]
Totally recommended.
