Denis is a highly configurable distributed system we created in MercadoLibre that aims to solve misconfigurations[^1] in cloud providers automatically at a big scale. 

Me and my project leader were part of the main track at the [EkoParty Security Conference](https://www.ekoparty.org/en_US/) of this year talking about the concepts behind the solution, some of the problems we faced and the future of this solution as an open source project. Watch it on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5bkckQWDbA)

It was the first time speaking in an event like this for me, and beyond the
talk was recorded with no public, I felt really comfortably doing it. I guess I
could repeat this experience anytime soon.

Regarding Denis, I had a bunch of fun developing this project and learned a lot during the process of making this system alive. Also, it served me as an excuse to read this book I had in my _read later queue_ from an eternity ago: [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/).[^2] Totally recommended.
