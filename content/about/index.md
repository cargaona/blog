I’m a dude living in Buenos Aires.

I do stuff with computers for a living. Also, I really like music, movies, mechanics, and an endless list of stuff. I’m a rabbit hole hunter.

This is a personal and not-so-professional blog. I write about things I’m curious, enthusiastic, or just find
interesting at the time I post them.
